The SystemVerilog code for `line_buffer` module extracts a window of pixel data from an image row buffer. It receives an entire image row as input and outputs a configurable window of pixel values, depending on the selected mode. The module supports different window sizes and positions using configurable parameters and input signals. It operates synchronously on the rising edge of a clock (`clk`) and includes an asynchronous active low reset (`rst_async_n`) to reset internal registers.

### Interface Signals

* **Clock** (`clk`): Synchronizes operations on its rising edge.
* **Reset** (`rst_async_n`): Active low, asynchronous reset that resets internal registers.
* **Mode Select Signal** (`i_mode`): A `NBW_MODE`-bit signal that selects the operation mode of the buffer.
* **Valid Input Signal** (`i_valid`): Active high signal, synchronous with `clk`. Indicates when the `i_row_image` input data is valid and can be processed.
* **Update Output Window Signal** (`i_update_window`): Active high signal, synchronous with `clk`. Indicates when `o_image_window` should be updated.
* **Image Row Input** (`i_row_image`): A `NBW_DATA*NS_COLUMN`-bit input representing a full row of the image.
* **Window Row Start** (`i_image_row_start`): A `NBW_ROW`-bit input that defines the starting row position of the window.
* **Window Column Start** (`i_image_col_start`): A `NBW_COL`-bit input that defines the starting column position of the window.
* **Window Output** (`o_image_window`): A `NBW_DATA*NS_R_OUT*NS_C_OUT`-bit output representing the extracted window.

### Functional Behavior

1. **Operation**
   * The module extracts a window of pixel values from the internal line buffer.
   * The window size and position are defined by `NS_R_OUT`, `NS_C_OUT`, `i_image_row_start`, and `i_image_col_start`.
   * The extracted window is output on `o_image_window`. This happens asynchronously.
   * The internal line buffer adds a row when an `i_valid` signal is asserted. All rows from the buffer are shifted down, the last row is discarded and the first row becomes the input row from `i_row_image`. This happens synchronously.

2. **Row Storing**
   * When an `i_valid` signal is asserted, the internal line buffer will be updated on the next rising edge of the `clk`. As an example, with `NBW_DATA = 8`, `NS_ROW = 3`, `NS_COLUMN = 3`, `i_row_image = 0xa6484d`, and the starting internal line buffer reset with all zeroes, the expected internal line buffer after the rising edge of the clock `clk` is shown below. Where the data stored in line `0`, column `0` is equal to 0xa6.

   | 0xa6  | 0x48  | 0x4d  |
   |-------|-------|-------|
   | 0x00  | 0x00  | 0x00  |
   | 0x00  | 0x00  | 0x00  |


3. **Modes of Operation** (Selected via `i_mode`):
   * All operation modes, when within range of the internal line buffer, will output the window by starting in the top left of the (i_image_row_start, i_image_col_start) position, where the first value is the row selection and the second value is the column selection. From that point, going to the right and down, a window with `NS_R_OUT` rows and `NS_C_OUT` columns is selected. The operation modes differ in the border handling, where either, or both, is true: (`i_image_row_start` + `NS_R_OUT` >= `NS_ROW`) or (`i_image_col_start` + `NS_C_OUT` >= `NS_COLUMN`).
   * `i_mode == 3'b000`: Any selection out of range will be outputted as `0`.
   * `i_mode == 3'b001`: Any selection out of range will be outputted as `CONSTANT`.
   * `i_mode == 3'b010`: Any selection out of range will be outputted as its closest value.
   * `i_mode == 3'b011`: Any selection out of range will be the mirrored position, that is, in the example of section 2's (Row Storing) functional behavior, if the `NS_R_OUT = 1`, `NS_C_OUT = 3`, `i_update_window = 1`, `i_image_row_start = 0` and `i_image_col_start = 2`, the output `o_image_window` must be 0x484d4d.
   * `i_mode == 3'b100`: Any selection out of range will be wrapped around the line buffer. Using the same example from `i_mode == 3'b011`, with the same inputs and parameters, the output `o_image_window` must be 0x48a64d.
   * `i_mode == 3'b101` to `i_mode == 3'b111`: Invalid modes, `o_image_window` must always be `0`.

4. **Output Connection**
   * The output is asynchronously asserted when `i_update_window` is asserted and can't change when `i_update_window` is set to `0`.
   * The output is changed when `i_update_window` is 1, and the window is selected according to the inputs `i_image_row_start`, `i_image_col_start`, `i_mode` and the internal line buffer register.
   * An example of its connection, where a two by two window is selected from position `0`, `0`, in any operation mode and using the internal line buffer below, would output `o_image_window` = 0x50716325.

   | 0x25  | 0x63  | 0xf0  |
   |-------|-------|-------|
   | 0x71  | 0x50  | 0x25  |
   | 0x65  | 0x5f  | 0x5f  |

# Observed Behavior

In the example below, the parameters were set to:
   * `NBW_DATA = 8`
   * `NS_ROW = 3`
   * `NS_COLUMN = 3`
   * `NS_R_OUT = 2`
   * `NS_C_OUT = 2`
   * `CONSTANT = 255`
   * `NBW_ROW = 2`
   * `NBW_COL = 2`
   * `NBW_MODE = 3`

All inputs were set after the rising edge of the clock `clk`, and after the next rising edge the `clk` the `o_image_window` was observed. The simulation started with a reset, where the internal line buffer must be set to 0, and then this output was observed:
